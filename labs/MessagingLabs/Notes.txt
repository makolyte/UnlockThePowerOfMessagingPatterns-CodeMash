* I'm using Visual Studio 2022 and already have Docker Desktop (on Windows).
* So the only part I had to do was:
  * Azure Service Bus Emulator: Azure Service Bus Emulator Installer
  * Swap out the Config.json file with the Config-codemash.json file
  * Run the script here: azure-service-bus-emulator-installer\ServiceBus-Emulator\Scripts\Windows
  * It will prompt you, say "Y"
  * Enter a password that meets complexity requirements, otherwise it will fail and you'll have to run it again
  * It will download all the images etc..
  * Go into Docker Desktop and start the two containers it made: sqledge and the azure bus one.
